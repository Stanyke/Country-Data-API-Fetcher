Index.html, This is where users can input their desired country's name and get some details about it from the RestFul API created by restcountries.eu but the default value there is my country "Nigeria", also all i wanted to fetch was The name of the country, Region, Populations, Timezone, Currrency, Languages, Calling Codes which should be displayed in a bootstrap dark table... You can find the script.js file in the same folder as this file. you can also upgrade to your satisfaction.

Script.js, This is the file that does all the work needed to be done, collecting data for the user from https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/{name} whereas the {name} should be replaced with any country of your choice.

Also in the recent update i added a div element with value "Get All Countries" when clicked it get all countries available.

Feel free to reach out to me, enchance to your satisfaction.
Happy coding...
